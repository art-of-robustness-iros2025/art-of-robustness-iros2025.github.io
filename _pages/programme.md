## Programme

The workshop features invited talks, panel discussions, and poster presentations. Each event will foster discussions, emphasizing interactions between early-career and senior researchers.

**Invited talks**: Invited speakers will share their latest research in 20-minute talks.

**Panel discussions**: 30-minute Q&A and panel discussions will take place at the end of the workshop. The organizers will moderate with questions from both in-person and online audiences.

**Poster presentations**: Selected poster contributions will have a 1-minute teaser in the Poster Spotlight session, followed by a poster session.
