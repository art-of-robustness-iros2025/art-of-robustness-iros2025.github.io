## Topics of Interest

We invite researchers to submit short papers on preliminary results, ongoing works, and demos relevant to the workshop. The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

### Fundamental Algorithms

- **Model-based and Learning-based Methods**
  - Robust model-based and learning-based methods to perceptual noise and uncertainties. 
  - Scalable and real-time decision making and whole-body control for complex robotic systems in dynamic environments.
  - Generalizable and adaptive learning: transferring models to novel environments and online learning to adapt to changing conditions. 
  - Combination of model-based and learning-based method.

- **Perception and Sensing**
  - Noise and fault reduction by sensor fusion, e.g., vision and tactile sensing. 
  - Real-time perception and sensing for dynamic environments.

- **Recovery and Learning from Failures**
  - Learning from failure cases to improve system resilience and performance over time.
  - Design of self-recovery strategies from failures. 

### Real-world Implementation

- Hardware system design and integration.
- Software engineering and integration.
- Sim-to-real transfer methods to close the gap between simulation and reality.
- Evaluation and testing protocols for testing, validating, and certifying robotic systems under real-world conditions. 

### Practical Aspect
- Nitty-gritty twists that are often overlooked in academic papers.
- Debugging process to identify and address the source of failures.

## Submission Instructions

We encourage participants to submit their research to _Link_ in the form of a short papers (2-4 pages, excluding references)  following the template and format guidelines given in the [IEEE Robotics and Automation Society](https://ras.papercept.net/conferences/support/support.php). 

Presenting already accepted work is also encouraged. In this case, authors should submit the accpted manuscript along with a poster summarizing theior research. 

Submission of video attachment and code is optional but highly encouraged.

All submissions will be reviewed based on quality, originality, and relevance. All accepted contributions will be presented as posters during the poster sessions. 

## Important Dates

**First Round Submission**
- **Submission Deadline**: 5th August 2025
- **Notification**: 20th August 2025

**Second Round Submission**
- **Submission Deadline**: 5th September 2025
- **Notification**: 20th September 2025

## Awards

A *Best Poster Award* will be presented during the workshop's closing session.
