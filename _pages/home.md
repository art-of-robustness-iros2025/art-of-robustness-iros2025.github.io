# The Art of Robustness: Surviving Failures in Robotics @ IROS 2025

*October 20, 2025 in Hangzhou, China*

## Abstract

In recent years, we have seen significant advancements in robotic systems. 
Humanoid robots can perform complex tasks, mobile manipulators show promise in logistics and industrial applications, and exoskeletons enhance human capabilities.
However, deploying robots in real-world applications still remains challenging. 
**A primary bottleneck is the occurrence of failures that compromise the robustness of robotic systems**, limiting their reliability in practical scenarios. 
Below is a video showing robot failures experienced by the workshop organizers, 
illustrating the impact of these failures in real-world settings.

<style>
  .video-wrapper {
    max-width: 1000px; /* Adjust the width as needed */
    height: auto; /* Adjust the height as needed */
    margin: 0 auto; /* Center the video */
    padding-bottom: 20px; /* Reduce the gap after the video */
  }
</style>

The primary objective of this workshop is to provide a platform for **discussing the key challenges that lead
to failures in robots**, such as perceptual noise, uncertainty in model-based methods, limited generalizability
in learning-based methods, and exploring **innovative solutions to mitigate these issues, thereby improving the
robustness of robotic systems**. The workshop will bring together world-renowned researchers and practitioners
from diverse fields, including whole-body model-based control, robot learning, perception and sensing, to share
their insights and experiences. The workshop will feature invited talks, poster sessions, and panel discussions,
offering attendees a comprehensive understanding on robustness challenges in robotics and highlight the latest
advancements and strategies for addressing these obstacles.

## Topics of Dicussion and Interest

The workshop will focus on the following topics:

- Analyzing the key challenges that lead to failures in robotics, namely perceptual noise, uncertainty in model-based methods, limited generalizability in learning-based methods. 

- Exploring innovative solutions to mitigate these issues, thereby improving the robustness of robotic systems. 

- System integration
